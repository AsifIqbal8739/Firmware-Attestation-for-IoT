# Firmware-Attestation-for-IoT-Security
This repo contains executable code to recreate the experimental results presented in the Paper: "RAM-Based Firmware Attestation for IoT Security: A Representation Learning Framework" 
Published in _______ Journal

The implementation code is in Python 3.9 and models are trained in PyTorch 1.13.0

Firmware Data should be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JZeTtAjk6uECuleqBF_LyAzPZNmPytQ4?usp=sharing and placed in the ./Data folder

VAE_Detection.py is the main file for Results Generation. The parameters are setup as given in the paper.
